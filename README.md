### Overview

This repositoty contains all the hands-on materials taught in the single-cell RNA-seq analysis using Python 2023 course. In this course we learn how to analyse single-cell data starting **from raw reads until the cell-type annotation of our data**. Moreover, we explore and perform **batch correction and data integration** for our data. The hands-on materials include practicals(demos), exercises and their answers, and project exercises for more hands-on practice.

### Repo contents 

- bin  : scripts necessary for preprocessing analysis
- envs : yml files, environments used for the practicals
- exercises : jupyter notebooks with exercises based on the practicals and their answers
- practicals : jupyter notebooks for each practical( demo, follow along tutorial for each session)
- projects : Coming soon
