### Overview

This repositoty contains all the hands-on materials taught in the course "Single-cell RNA-seq analysis using Python 2023". Here, we learn how to analyse single-cell data starting **from raw reads until the cell-type annotation of our data**. Moreover, we explore and perform **batch correction and data integration methods** for our data. The hands-on materials include practicals(demos), exercises with answer keys, and project exercises for further hands-on practice.

### Repo contents 

- bin  : scripts necessary for preprocessing analysis
- envs : yml files, environments used for the practicals
- exercises : jupyter notebooks with exercises based on the practicals and their answers
- practicals : jupyter notebooks for each practical( demo, follow along tutorial for each session)
- projects : Coming soon

### From raw reads to feature selection

practical_1 is a follow along tutorial for the preprocessing analysis of single-cell data. This includes the following steps : 

1. Raw Data Processing 
   1.1 Build the reference index
   1.2 Perform mapping and quantification (alevin fry and simpleleaf wrapper)
2. Quality Control (QC)
   2.1 Filtering low quality barcodes
   2.2 Correction of ambient RNA
   2.3 Doublet Detection
4. Normalisation
5. Feature Selection 

### Dimensionality reduction, clustering, and annotation

### Batch correction and data integration

### Group Projects
